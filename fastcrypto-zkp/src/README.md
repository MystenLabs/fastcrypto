# fastcrypto-zkp

Fastcrypto-zkp is an experimental crate that offers a faster implementation of the Groth16 zkSNARK
verifier, based on BLST, but following the same API as Arkworks' Groth16 implementation.
It includes benchmarks and tests to compare the performance and native formats of the two implementations.
